    <h2 class="section-heading">Project Overview</h2>

    <p>
        Global mean surface temperature is one of the most widely used and trusted indicators of climate change. 
        From 1924 to 2024, our planet has undergone dramatic shifts in climate conditions — reshaping ecosystems, 
        weather patterns, and human livelihood. Studying this 100-year window allows us to observe the transition 
        from early industrial conditions to the rapid warming driven by modern fossil fuel use, industrialization, 
        and urban expansion.
    </p>

    <p>
        Our goal is to transform abstract climate statistics into meaningful visual evidence. Through data 
        visualizations, we trace how natural fluctuations evolved into persistent warming trends, and how 
        historical developments align with measurable temperature changes across land and ocean surfaces. 
    </p>

    <h2 class="section-heading">Goal of the Project</h2>

    <p>
        To visualize and analyze global land and ocean surface temperature changes over the past century, 
        highlighting long-term warming patterns and their connections to historical climate-influencing events.
    </p>

    <h2 class="section-heading">Data Introduction</h2>

    <p>
        For this project, we use the <strong>NASA GISTEMP v4</strong> dataset published by the  
        NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS). This dataset provides monthly and annual global 
        surface temperature anomalies from 1880 to the present. We focus on the most recent 100 years 
        (1924–2024) to assess how Earth’s climate has shifted across the 20th and 21st centuries.
    </p>

    <p>
        Each NASA record includes the year, global temperature anomaly relative to the 1951–1980 baseline, 
        and separate land/ocean averages. To improve reliability, we also compare against  
        <strong>NOAA’s Global Temperature (NOAAGlobalTemp)</strong> dataset, which uses a similar structure 
        with slight methodological differences. Together, these datasets provide a robust and standardized view 
        of long-term global temperature change.

        <h3 class="viz-title">NASA Temperature Anomalies by Decade (1924–2024)</h3>
        <p>
            This bar chart visualizes how the global average temperature anomaly has changed by decade using 
            NASA’s land–ocean surface temperature index. Early decades—from the 1920s through the 1960s—show 
            negative or near-zero anomalies, meaning global temperatures were cooler than the 1951–1980 climate baseline. 
            Beginning in the 1970s, anomalies shift above zero, marking the onset of accelerated warming. After 1980, each 
            decade becomes noticeably hotter than the one before it, rising from roughly +0.25°C in the 1980s to more than 
            +1.0°C in the 2020s. This visualization reveals a steady and intensifying warming trend across the century.

        <h3 class="viz-title">3D “Warming Wall” of Annual Global Temperature Anomalies</h3>
        <p>
            This 3D surface visualization represents annual global temperature anomalies from 1924 to 2024. 
            The X-axis marks each year, and the Z-axis shows the temperature anomaly relative to the 1951–1980 baseline. 
            Extending these anomalies along the Y-axis creates a “warming wall” effect. The color scale transitions from 
            blue (cooler-than-average years) to deep red (warmer-than-average years). Early decades are dominated by cool 
            blues, while recent decades shift into intense reds — with the highest anomalies appearing after 2000. 
            The 3D perspective makes the century-long warming trend visually striking and easy to interpret.

        <h3 class="viz-title">NOAA Global Temperature Anomalies with 10-Year Rolling Average</h3>
        <p>
            This visualization displays NOAA global temperature anomaly data over the past century. The light gray line 
            represents year-to-year variability, showing natural fluctuations. The dark red line is a 10-year rolling average, 
            which smooths out short-term noise to reveal long-term trends. The smoothed curve shows a clear acceleration in 
            warming beginning in the late 20th century, corresponding to the rise in greenhouse gas emissions. This chart 
            emphasizes that global warming is a persistent, long-term trend — not an isolated spike.

        <h3 class="viz-title">Early vs Modern Warming Era: Distribution Shift (1924–2024)</h3>
        <p>
            This distribution comparison divides the data into two 50-year periods using NOAA temperature anomaly data: 
            1924–1974 and 1975–2024. The earlier distribution (blue) clusters around cooler or negative anomalies, showing 
            that the planet’s climate was historically cooler relative to the 1951–1980 baseline. The modern distribution 
            (orange) shifts dramatically to the right, revealing consistently warmer anomalies and a significantly higher mean 
            temperature. This shift demonstrates that global warming is not just about the hottest individual years — the entire 
            climate system has moved into a new, warmer state.
